# Rewards Distribution

The rewards distribution mechanism in UniFi AVS is designed to provide a consistent and attractive incentive structure for participating validators.

## Key Features

1. **Pre-confirmation Fees**: Users pay pre-conf fees to validators who commit to including their transactions when proposing a block.

2. **Reward Characteristics**: 
   - Volatile
   - Infrequent Payouts
   - Economies of Scale

3. **MEV-Smoothing**: Implemented to distribute rewards more evenly over time.

4. **Ether Payouts**: All rewards are paid out in Ether (ETH).

5. **Competitive Earnings**: Validators have the potential to earn consistent and smooth Ether revenue that may exceed earnings from today's PBS (Proposer-Builder Separation) pipeline.

This reward structure aims to create a compelling economic incentive for validators to participate in the pre-confirmation process, benefiting both validators and the overall Ethereum network.
