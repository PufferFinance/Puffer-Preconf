# Rewards Distribution

The rewards distribution mechanism in UniFi AVS is designed to smoothen out volatility in rewards to provide consistent and sustainable revenue for validators that potentially surpasses revenue from the standard PBS pipeline.

## Key Features

1. **Pre-confirmation Fees**: Users pay pre-conf fees to validators who commit to including their transactions when proposing a block.

2. **Reward Characteristics**: 
   - Volatile
   - Infrequent Payouts
   - Economies of Scale

3. **MEV-Smoothing**: Implemented to distribute rewards more evenly over time.

4. **Ether Payouts**: All rewards are paid out in Ether (ETH).

5. **Competitive Earnings**: Validators have the potential to earn consistent and smooth Ether revenue that may exceed earnings from today's PBS (Proposer-Builder Separation) pipeline.

This reward structure aims to create a compelling economic incentive for validators to participate in the pre-confirmation process, benefiting both validators and the overall Ethereum network.
