# UniFi Reward Scripts

This directory contains scripts for managing rewards in the UniFi protocol.

## Setup

### Environment File

Create a `.env` file in the `l2-contracts` directory with the following variables:

```
PK=your_private_key
RPC_URL=your_rpc_endpoint
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_distributor_contract_address
```

- `PK`: Private key used for transactions
- `RPC_URL`: RPC endpoint URL for the network
- `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: UnifiRewardsDistributor contract address

## Available Commands

The project includes a Makefile with the following commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make help` | Display available commands (default) |
| `make build` | Build contracts with `--via-ir` optimization |
| `make deploy-distributor [BROADCAST=true]` | Deploy a new UnifiRewardsDistributor contract |
| `make submit-merkle-root [BROADCAST=true]` | Generate and submit a Merkle root from the CSV file |
| `make cancel-merkle-root [BROADCAST=true]` | Cancel a pending Merkle root |
| `make check-merkle-root-status` | Check the status of current and pending Merkle roots |
| `make claim-rewards [BROADCAST=true]` | Claim rewards for validators in the CSV file |

Notes:
- Add `BROADCAST=true` to broadcast transactions to the network
- You can override the distributor address with `DISTRIBUTOR=0x...`

## CSV Format

The script reads validator data from `script/bls_keys.csv` with the following format:

```
0x93ed1a759289118d6f0f71545574f622769860089bb5e0d5989fa148a38484c780bb4df010677cc12495641a4c6d7d23,1000000000000000000
0xa06ed93c03bdea0f7d6747be3feff5c5ced92b76a576c1712c3b0d049a4eb16a58437ae31f4831a217ff0b34b769a8b2,2000000000000000000
```

Each line contains:
- BLS public key (hex format)
- Token amount (in wei)

## Registering a Claimer

Before validators can claim rewards, a claimer must be registered for each validator. This is done using the `set-claimer-signature-generator` JavaScript tool.

### Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the signature generator directory
cd set-claimer-signature-generator

# Install dependencies
yarn install
```

### Validator Keystores

The script requires validator keystore files that follow the EIP-2335 standard (such as those created by the [staking-deposit-cli](https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli)). Place these files in a directory:

```
my-validators/
├── keystore-m_12381_3600_0_0_0-1234567890.json
├── keystore-m_12381_3600_0_0_0-0987654321.json
└── ...
```

### Running the Registration Script

```bash
node index.js \
  --claimer 0xYourClaimerAddress \
  --rpc-url https://your-rpc-endpoint.com \
  --unifi-private-key 0xYourPrivateKey \
  --keystore-path ./my-validators \
  --password YourKeystorePassword
```

Parameters:
- `--claimer` - Ethereum address that will claim rewards (can be a wallet, multisig, or contract)
- `--rpc-url` - RPC endpoint for the UniFi L2 network
- `--unifi-private-key` - Private key with ETH to pay for gas (must be in hex format with 0x prefix)
- `--keystore-path` - Directory containing validator keystore files
- `--password` - Password to decrypt the keystore files

The script will:
1. Load each keystore file from the specified directory
2. Generate a signature authorizing the claimer address
3. Submit a transaction to register the claimer for all validators in one operation

## Complete Workflow

### 1. Deploy the UnifiRewardsDistributor Contract

```bash
# First time setup - deploy a new distributor contract
make deploy-distributor BROADCAST=true

# Update your .env file with the new CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

### 2. Prepare Validator Data

Edit the `script/bls_keys.csv` file with your validator BLS public keys and token amounts.

### 3. Submit a Merkle Root

```bash
# Dry run to verify the Merkle root calculation
make submit-merkle-root

# Submit the Merkle root to the blockchain
make submit-merkle-root BROADCAST=true
```

### 4. Check Merkle Root Status

```bash
# Check when the Merkle root will be activated
make check-merkle-root-status
```

### 5. Claim Rewards

```bash
# Dry run to verify the claim process
make claim-rewards

# Claim rewards on the blockchain
make claim-rewards BROADCAST=true
```

### 6. Cancel a Pending Merkle Root (if needed)

```bash
make cancel-merkle-root BROADCAST=true
```

All commands use the `--via-ir` optimization flag for better gas efficiency.

## Script Details

### SubmitMerkleRoot Script

This script reads BLS pubkeys and amounts from the CSV file, generates a Merkle root, and submits it to the UnifiRewardsDistributor contract. It also provides functions to cancel pending roots and check root status.

### ClaimRewards Script

This script reads BLS pubkeys and amounts from the CSV file, generates Merkle proofs, and claims rewards for validators. It automatically calculates BLS pubkey hashes and proper proofs.

### DeployUnifiRewardsDistributor Script

This script deploys a new UnifiRewardsDistributor contract and sets the contract owner to the address derived from your private key.
